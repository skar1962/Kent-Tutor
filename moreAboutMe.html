				<h2>My professional CV</h2>
				
				<p><span class="blackText">
					I graduated from university in the 80's and have since had a very successful career in the IT/Software industry 
					as a Director of Software Development.  I have managed teams as large as 150 people with multiple hi-profile and complicated projects in progress at the same time. <br><br>
					Late in 2016, I decided to end my IT career and focus on ventures that bring enjoyment with a slower pace of life. One of the things I enjoyed in the past was to 
					help my two boys with passing their 11+ exams. I also recently helped a friends daughter pass her entrance examinations for the local Grammer school for girls.
					<br>
					I would like to offer these skills to others and hence am available as a part time as a tutor. 
					<br><br>
					If you are interested in my professional IT career, my professional CV is viewable <a href="Sudesh Patel CV 2017.pdf">here</a>.

				<h2>Family life</h2>
				<p><span class="blackText">
					I am married and have been lucky enough to have two boys who both attained very high scores in their 11+ exams, attended university and left with good honours degrees. 
					The eldest son now works in Berlin and leads a team of Web developers for a well known company.  The youngest is starting out his career at an audio and video production studio 
					in Sittingbourne - not too far away!
					<br><br> With both boys now having flown the nest, my Wife and I are enjoying our time together with plenty of vacation time thrown in.
